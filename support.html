        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        
        <h2>I tried to recover my wallet, why is the transaction history blank?</h2>
        <p>
           When recovering your wallet using the 12 word seed phrase, you have to use the exact same password/passphrase that you chose when creating the original wallet. The password/passphrase acts as the "13th word" of your recovery seed.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is my transaction taking a long time to confirm?</h2>
        <p>
           Miners choose to confirm the highest bidding transactions based on their fee rate (measured in sats/vbyte). You can add fees to speed up an unconfirmed transaction by clicking the rocket icon in your transaction history. Each additional input and output included in a transaction increases its size, which requires more fees to be paid.<br>
            <br>
            Coinjoins are very large transactions with many inputs and outputs, so it is expensive to speed them up.
        </p>

        <h2>The timer in the coinjoin box counted down and then reset, why didn't my privacy progress % increase?</h2>
        <p>
        All of the participants in a coinjoin have to sign it in order for the transaction to be valid. If someone enters a coinjoin and disconnects before signing it, it will cause the timer to reset for the other participants. Non-signers are temporarily blocked from participating in the next round, so honest users with stable Internet connections will eventually build a successful coinjoin.
        </p>

        <h2>Why does it say "skipping a round for better privacy"?</h2>
        <p>
        Skipping rounds is a feature that smooths out liquidity, saves on mining fees, and increases randomness. You can disable random round skipping by going into your Wallet json file (search "Wallet Folder" in Wasabi's searchbar), looking for the line "CoinjoinSkipFactors": "0.7_0.8_0.9", and replacing it with "CoinjoinSkipFactors": "1_1_1",
        </p>

        <h2>My privacy progress is stuck at 99%, why does it say "Insufficient funds eligible for coinjoin"?</h2>
        <p>
        A UTXO must have a value of at least 0.00005000 BTC to be eligible to coinjoin. If you are stuck at 99% privacy progress, check the "Wallet Coins" menu to see if you have a UTXO with a value that is too low to participate. Hovering over the shield icon in the transaction preview screen helps you avoid creating small change UTXOs from payments you send.
